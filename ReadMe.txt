First off, this is going to be my **big** project I'll be fiddling with

I wanted to seperate what I was working on into different stages and components
So my first idea is to create a mockup page using svelte of how I'd want 
this to work. 

I've attached an image of the mockup for the ui, and will be working on
recreating that first.

for my mockup.
